  <p>Healthy food and food access initiatives are most successful when those
    communities most impacted are not only active participants, but also
    leaders in the transformation efforts. The Community Farm Project
    competitive grants program awards grants to eligible nonprofits,
    tribal organizations, and food program service providers to promote
    self-sufficiency and increase food security in low-income communities
    by developing comprehensive, community-based solutions. Projects vary in
    scope, ranging from community gardens with market stands to marketing and
    consumer cooperatives, but all must involve low-income participants.</p>
