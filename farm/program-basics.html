    CFP is a competitive grants program that is administered by the U.S.
    Department of Agricultureâ€™s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture
    (NIFA). Grants are intended to help eligible nonprofits, tribal organizations,
    and food program service providers in need of a one-time infusion of federal
    assistance for projects that promote self-sufficiency and food security in
    low-income communities. These one-time grants require a dollar-for-dollar
    (1:1) match in resources, which can include in-kind support.</p>
